# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

[Tutorial on how to setup Cloudinary for Strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/add-cloudinary-support-to-your-strapi-application)

You cannot store your assets in the uploads folder on Heroku, since your uploads will be lost after Heroku [rebuilds the app](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment/hosting-guides/heroku.html#file-uploads). The filesystem only lasts until the dyno is restarted. In the free tier, this is done more regurarly since Heroku will stop your dyno after 30 mins.
You only need to have a free account on Cloudinary.
In addition, do not forget to set your cloudinary credentials as env vars for your Heroku application!

You only need to have a free Heroku account. You can also have a Postgres database for free.
